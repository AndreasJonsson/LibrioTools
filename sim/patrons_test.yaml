# Common for both branchcodes and patroncategories: 
# If you want one branch to have more borrowers then the others, add it multiple times to 
# the list multiple times. In this example, CPL is represented three times and FFL and FRL
# one time each. This means that CPL will have about three times as many patrons as either 
# one of FFL and FRL. The same goes for patroncategories.
