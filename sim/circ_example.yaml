# Maximum and minimum issues that should be made in a day
# This should account for your daily averages, and can be 
# modified based on week of the year and/or day of the
# week with the settings further down in this file

min_issues_per_day: 25

# Weeks - Not implemented yet! 
# If there are weeks where you want the number of issues to 
# be different than the average max and mins defined above
# you can list them here, along with a change in number of
# issues given as a percentage. If you want a busy week with
# twice the number of issues you give it a percentage of 200
# and a slow week with half the number of issues gets a 
# percentage of 50. 
# You only need to list the weeks that should differ from 
# the average here!

# Days - Not implemented yet
# This works similar to weeks, slow days of the week get
# a low percentage (below 100), weeks with more issues than
# average get a high percentage (above 100). Only days that
# should differ from the average need to be listed here.
